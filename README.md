# 📊 data-and-forensics

**Demonstrating forensic data models, T-SQL/Python analytics, and evidence structure used to identify systemic abuse and conspiracy.**

This repository publicly outlines the analytical methodologies and pseudo-code/scripts used to identify statistical and behavioral anomalies within aggregated, pseudonymized data, which are indicative of widespread negligence or criminal conspiracy ($\text{§} 1983, \text{§} 1985, \text{§} 1986$ analysis).

## I. 🔬 Forensic Data Modeling

This outlines the analytical philosophy used to structure case data for legal scrutiny and pattern detection.

* **Evidence Structure & Schema:** Public documentation of the high-level, normalized data schema (based on your **MCSE/MCSA** knowledge) designed to support complex, relational queries required for litigation.
* **Pattern-of-Life Analysis:** Pseudocode and design documents detailing how timestamped event data (e.g., filings, denials, communication lags) are analyzed against baseline operational expectations to flag **unusual procedural deviations**.
* **Relational Entity Mapping (Conspiracy Graph):** Demonstrates how **SQL/T-SQL** relational data structures are used to link disparate events, individuals, and jurisdictions to visually establish a network or "graph" of potential conspirators.

## II. 💻 Analytical Code & Technology Focus

This section highlights the technical application of your data expertise to the core mission.

* **T-SQL/PL-SQL Scripts:** Examples of stored procedures and functions designed for complex join operations essential for **cross-case comparative analysis** (e.g., finding all cases linked to the same two professionals over a five-year period).
* **Python/Pandas Frameworks:** Scripts for data cleaning, aggregation, and statistical testing (e.g., $\text{chi-squared}$ or $\text{T-tests}$) on pseudonymized data sets to confirm if patterns of misconduct are **statistically significant** or simply random occurrences.
* **Negligence Thresholds:** Publicly defined analytical criteria used to distinguish routine errors from a statistically significant pattern of **willful blindness** ($\text{§} 1986$ analysis).

## III. 🔑 Evidence Integrity Link

This reinforces the connection to your security efforts, establishing data quality for sponsors.

* **Data Integrity Checkpoints:** Outlines where data quality, integrity checks, and validation processes are implemented within the analytics pipeline to ensure data has not been compromised before being used for pattern detection.
* **Audit Logging Standards:** Commitment to internal audit logging of all analytical queries and data transformations, ensuring that the **analytical chain of custody** is as robust as the evidence collection chain.
