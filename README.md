# 📊 data-and-forensics

**Showcasing data modeling, analytical techniques, and forensic standards for systems requiring high-integrity evidence and pattern detection.**

This repository details the analytical methodologies, data management models, and techniques used to transform raw data into legally sound evidence and actionable intelligence across diverse high-stakes projects. It demonstrates deep expertise in **Data Analytics and Data Forensics**.

## I. 🔬 Forensic Data Modeling & Integrity

This section highlights the technical rigor used to structure and manage data to withstand legal scrutiny, drawing on **MCSE/MCSA** expertise.

* **Evidence Structure & Schema:** Public documentation of high-level, normalized data schemas designed to support complex, relational queries and maintain data integrity throughout the analysis lifecycle.
* **Data Integrity Checkpoints:** Outlines protocols for where data quality and integrity checks are implemented within the analytics pipeline to ensure data has not been compromised before being used for pattern detection.
* **Audit Logging Standards:** Commitment to internal audit logging of all analytical queries and data transformations, ensuring that the **analytical chain of custody** is as robust as the evidence collection chain.

## II. 💻 Analytical Techniques & Pattern Detection

This focuses on the use of data science and SQL proficiency to discover complex relationships and systemic failures.

* **Relational Entity Mapping:** Demonstrates how **SQL/T-SQL** relational data structures are used to link disparate events, individuals, and systems to visually establish complex relationship networks for pattern and conspiracy detection.
* **Pattern-of-Life Analysis:** Documentation detailing how event data is analyzed against baseline operational expectations to flag **unusual procedural deviations or statistical anomalies**.
* **Statistical Analysis Frameworks:** Scripts (e.g., Python/Pandas) for data cleaning, aggregation, and statistical testing used to confirm if detected patterns are **statistically significant** or merely random occurrences.
* **Thresholds & Criteria:** Analytical definitions and criteria used to distinguish routine errors from statistically significant patterns indicative of **willful blindness or negligence**.

## III. 🔑 Evidence Handling Protocols

This section demonstrates the standards necessary for producing data suitable for litigation and investigation.

* **Forensic Tool Interoperability:** Documentation on standards and formats that ensure data collected and analyzed can be reliably integrated with external forensic tools and legal platforms.
* **Data Export Verification:** Protocols for securely packaging evidence (including manifest files and hash verification procedures) to ensure integrity during data handoff for investigative or legal review.
